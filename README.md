To Start Program Run:

``
python passwordgen.py
``

## Usage

2. Choose character preferences by changing button states from yes/no.

3. Press the Generate Password button and copy your final password from the output box.

## Reflection

**- What was the context for this project?**

Initially, a terminal version of this project was developed. While it was simple and effective, it wasn't the most usable as it didn't have user based elements. Using Tkinter, the basic window can be visualized just as quickly as a terminal can but with a more usable interface.


**- What tools were used?**

The main development was done purely in python with the help of the Tkinter GUI module.
